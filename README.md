# Praxi-Conventions

> Made possible by all the contributors. Thank you.

This is a repository made to list numbers of conventions that can be adopted in newly created repositories while also providing templates for files or links to existing ones.

## Goals and inspiration

This project is inspired by the lack of established rules and conventions in many repositories by newer developers and the desire to help create one well-documented environment that adhere to common conventions and rules.

An example of this is myself (Zakrok09). I only realized that there are conventions for commit messages and branch names really late. This repository aims to streamline the process of finding those conventions and establish professional standards more easily.
